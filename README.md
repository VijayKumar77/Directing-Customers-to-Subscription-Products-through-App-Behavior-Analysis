# Directing-Customers-to-Subscription-Products-through-App-Behavior-Analysis
• The company wants to sell the premium version app with low advertisement cost. They gave the premium feature in the free app for 24 hours to collect customer behavior. 
• They hired a Machine Learning Engineer to find customers interested in buying the product. Offers will only be given to those who are interested but cannot afford it. 
• Our main aim to target the customer who are willing to enrolled for the premium version of the application.
• This is classification-based problem.
